The fake data generator can be used to generate a fake Book catalog dataset with tunable parameters for data set size, 
desired no. of states in the data set, and entropy in no. of additions/modifications/removal in between states. This fake  
dataset helps OSS developers synthesize a dataset of a fairly complex data model, to test functional or performance changes
against. 

Run the `main` method to generate data locally, or simply downloaded pre-generated data from a publicly accessible S3 bucket 
by following instructions in the user docs.
